* What server framework did you choose and why?<br>
This application uses Ruby on Rails as a server framework. Ruby on rails was chosen over other frameworks because it is high in demand in market. Moreover it was easy to learn and development phase was paced up with the use of gems. It is robust, easy to maintain and stable. The automation provided by the gems makes the development process less tedious than in any other convectional framework. Apart from the development framework, it provides a separate testing and production framework to be used in respective environment.

* What client framework did you choose and why?<br>
Angular JS was chosen as client side framework as it supports MVC architecture, RESTful APIs etc which was one of the important requirement of the project. Apart from that, the biggest advantage is AngularJS provides declarative two-way-databinding which is an important aspect of an interactive web application.

* What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?<br>
The implementation of plugins which were provided by the ruby libraries made the development process easy to understand and implement.

* What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?<br>
The integration of client side framework and server side framework was a tedious task as to understand the flow of control and passing of data from front end to back end was perplexing.

* What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?<br>
NONE apart from the gems like responders and rail_12factor and scripts

* What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?<br>
The commands (on windows) that were required to run the server
  1. rails s- to launch the server(WEBrick)
  2. Ctrl+C – To stop the server and return to command line
  3. –d to detach
